**Project Overview**

This project aims to implement a transformer network in Python using the PyTorch framework for multi-class classification of environmental audio recordings. The project is divided into two parts:

Architecture 1: A 1D-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction followed by a fully-connected layer for classification.
Architecture 2: A similar 1D-CNN for feature extraction followed by a transformer encoder network with a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and an MLP head for classification.
The dataset consists of 400 environmental audio recordings categorized into 10 different classes.

**Objective:**
The main objective of this project was to get familiarised with the encoder part of the transformer architecture and concepts like multihead self-attention mechanism, embedding, layer normalization etc.
